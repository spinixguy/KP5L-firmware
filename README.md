# KP5L-firmware

This repository contains firmware for the half-assembled version of the KP5L 3D printer from Kingroon. You should not use this firmware on any other printer.

KP5L-half assembled-autolevel.zip and KP5L-half assembled-manual-level.zip are stock verisons of the firmware from Kingroon.
The main difference between this firmware and that which you can download from Kingroon is that the configuration file has been translated to English.

Kingroon-KP5L-Marlin-2.1.1-MBL.zip and Kingroon-KP5L-Marlin-2.1.1-ABL.zip are configured versions of Marlin 2.1.1 for the KP5L printer.

The MBL suffix denotes Manual bed leveling.
The ABL suffix denotes Automatic bed leveling. 

NOTE: If you use the ABL version you should aslo use the probe mount listed here. The offsets are calibrated for this mount.
